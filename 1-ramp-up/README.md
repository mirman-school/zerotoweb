# Ramp Up with Markdown

## Introduction

In this course, we'll be tackling the three languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Of these, the most import is HTML.

## HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language has been around since 1993. Originally designed by Tim Berners-Lee as a way to share scientific papers over the newborn internet, HTML is by far the most prevalent and stable file format of our era. We interact with more HTML on a daily basis than any other structured language.

The relationship between them can be described this way:

| **Language** | **HTML** | **JS** |  **CSS**
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTML** | is | controlled by | styled by
| **JS** | controls | is | dynamically uses  
| **CSS** | styles | dynamically used by | is

Or, put visually:

But the primary component is the HTML file. All the rest is connected to that. Before we jump into HTML, let's get comfortable with our toolchain and our workflow. To do that, we're going to start making content with a simpler version of HTML known as Markdown.

### Markdown

HTML, as the name indicates, is a *markup language*. Using special characters, you can structure a document according to the organization of its content. Markdown does the same thing, with a massively-simplified syntax. So we're going to start our journey with Markdown.

#### CommonMark

There are a few flavors of Markdown out there, but I like to standardize on the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) specification. Let's click on that link and learn the basics of Markdown together.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective

There is a file in this repository called `EXPECTATIONS.md`. It's empty! Your job is to fill it up using the Markdown skills you've just practices. We're looking for at least the following:

* First-level headings
* Second-level headings
* Bold/italic formatting
* Unordered/ordered lists
* Links

In this file, write a bit about your expectations from the course, as well as expecations you have for *yourself*.

### Bonus Objectives

Push yourself! See if you can add images as well, or maybe even a table!

## Turning it in

To submit your work, you will have to use the Git tools built into VSCode. We'll go over those together. But remember these basics steps:

1. Stage changes
2. Commit changes
3. Push commit to GitHub

Don't worry; we'll explain it all soon.
